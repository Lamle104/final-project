halfaro1's Final Project Proposal

### Name
Lam Le

### Proposed Project Description
Something that I would like to do for my final project would be a reminder of the birthdays of my best friends and what I plan on getting them. This program tells me the names and dates of my best friends. It also includes what I plan on getting them on their birthdays. The program limits the program to ONLY remember birthdays/gifts while its running. If their birthdays aren't in the database then the user can enter the date.

### Connecting Concepts
Chapter 2 flow control and chapter 5 dictionaries.

### Timing
Project may take a few hours or a day.

### Asking for...
Some ways to better the program or any feedback is fine.
